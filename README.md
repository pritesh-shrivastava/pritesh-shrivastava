I'm an experienced data scientist (~5 yrs) passionate about using machine learning and deep learning for real-world delivery and impact. 

I enjoy exploring state-of-the-art techniques to solve data science problems on competitive platforms like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/priteshshrivastava). I also maintain a technical blog [here](https://pritesh-shrivastava.github.io/).

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently reading [Structure & Implementation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html) and adding my solutions to it's exercises in [this repo](https://github.com/pritesh-shrivastava/sicp_solutions). I'm also interested in functional programming in languages like Haskell & Racket.

You can check out my reading list & reviews on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23475269-pritesh-shrivastava). I've also added a few whistling tunes on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/pritesh-shrivastava).
