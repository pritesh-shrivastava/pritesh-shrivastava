### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an experienced data scientist (~5 yrs) passionate about using machine learning and deep learning for real-world delivery and impact. 

I enjoy exploring state-of-the-art techniques to solve data science problems on competitive platforms like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/priteshshrivastava). 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently reading ([The Wizard Book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html)?!) Structure & Implementation of Computer Programs (SICP) and adding my solutions to it's exercises in [this repo](https://github.com/pritesh-shrivastava/sicp_solutions). I'm also interested in functional programming in languages like Haskell & Racket.

I've added a few whistling tunes on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/pritesh-shrivastava) and my reading list is maintained on Goodreads.
